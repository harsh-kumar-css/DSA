what is OOPS ?

    Object oriented programming is a programming paradigm which is based on the concepts classes and objects.
    In object oriented programming ,we define every enity as a class, having some properties and behaviour.

Advantage of OOPS : 
    - It gives better code management and reuseability of code

class - it is a user defined , not primitive data type
        it is a description of an object

object - it is a instance of a class


Encapsulation - binding the similiar data into a single unit is called Encapsulation , the act of making classes in OOPs is used to achieve
                Encapsulation

Inheritance - when a class inherits the properties of another class it is known as inheritance , like
              a sports car inherits the properties of a class, so parent class is car ,and child class is sports car

              - single inheritance
              - multilevel inheritance
              - multiple inheritance
              - heirarichal inheritance
              - hybrid inheritance
